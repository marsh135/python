Requirements
1. Create a Gradebook
- Use a dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of grades.
- Add at least 3 students initially, each with at least 3 grades.
2. User Input
- Allow the user to:
  - Add a new student
  - Add grades for an existing student
  - View the gradebook summary
3. Calculations
- For each student, calculate the average grade.
- Identify and print the student with the highest average.
4. Display
- Print a clear summary of all students, their grades, and their average.
- Example output:
  - Alice: [90, 85, 92] Average: 89.0
  - Bob: [78, 81, 86] Average: 81.7
  - Top Student: Alice
