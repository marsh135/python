**Text-Based Adventure Game**


**Project Overview**


To kick off the year, you’ll be building your own text-based adventure game in Python.
Your game should take the player on a journey where they make choices that affect the outcome of the story. Think of it like a “choose-your-own-adventure” book — but coded by you.

This project will serve as a review of core Python concepts you learned last year:  

•	Input & output  
•	Variables & data types  
•	Conditional logic (if/elif/else)  
•	Loops (while, for)

Your goal is to design a fun, interactive experience that takes 5–10 minutes to play.


**Project Requirements**

Your program must:  
	1.	Welcome the player and ask for their name.  
	2.	Present choices using input and conditional statements (e.g., “Do you go left or right?”).  
	3.	Use at least one loop to handle replaying, invalid input, or repeated actions.  
	4.	Include at least two different endings based on player choices.  
	5.	Track at least one variable (like score, health, or items).  
	6.	Be easy to read and run without errors.  


**Optional Enhancements**

Want a challenge? Add one or more of these:  
	•	An inventory system (track items the player picks up).  
	•	Random events (using Python’s random module).  
	•	More than two possible endings.  
	•	ASCII art or text formatting to enhance the story.  
	•	A “save” mechanic (store progress in variables)  


**Deliverables**  

• A Python file named: FL_adventure_game.py  

• A short README.md with:  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  • Your name  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   • A one-sentence summary of your game  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	• Instructions on how to play  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	• Use https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/index.html to help with MarkDown


**Timeline**

•	Day 1: Brainstorm and outline your story. Start coding the intro and first choices.  
•	Day 2: Add more branches, endings, and variables.  
•	Day 3: Polish, test, and turn in your project.  

**Grading (20 points total)**

•	Functionality (10 pts): Program runs without errors, meets requirements.  
•	Creativity (5 pts): Story is engaging, fun, or clever.  
•	Code Quality (5 pts): Clear, readable, well-organized code (indentation, naming, comments).  



**Have fun with this! Be creative — it’s your world to design.**
